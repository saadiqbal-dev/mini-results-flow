          This is your potential, what your body could lose if it's in
          fat-burning mode. But that depends on getting your metabolism working
          with you, not against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Low energy, stubborn cravings, and slow progress usually mean your
          body is still burning sugar instead of fat â€” and that keeps weight
          loss stuck.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#F75950] font-inter text-base">
          With your numbers, results could show up even faster than expected,
          but only if your metabolism is dialed in and you're burning fat, not
          sugar.
