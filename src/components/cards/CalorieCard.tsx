          Your body burns calories just to stay alive â€” that's your BMR. Add in
          movement, and you burn even more. Eat less than you burn? You lose
          weight. Eat more? You store it. Simple math, but the *type* of
          calories still makes or breaks your results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people eat low-quality calories that spike cravings, crash
          energy, and cause fat to stick â€” even if they're technically under
          their daily limit.
